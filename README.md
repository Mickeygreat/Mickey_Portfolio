# [Project 1: Data Analysis with Python](https://github.com/Mickeygreat/CS602/tree/main)  
• Created a highly interactive website with streamlit that accepts all file types(Github has trouble with the function accepting all files, so switched it out for file upload) 
• Cleaned and manipulated data with pandas to get desired information
• Showed basic statistical measures, implemented an interactive world map to present data related to location, selectable X & Y axis scatter plot, and interactive pie chart
