# [Project 1: Data Analysis with Python](https://github.com/Mickeygreat/CS602/tree/main)  

This is a project from my summer python class CS602. This was my first time learning python to do data analysis, eventhough the learning process wasn't easy, I still managed to improve from knowing nothing about python to now an individual who can think logically with codes and write 300-400+ with ease.

* Created a highly interactive website with streamlit that accepts all file types(Github has trouble with the function accepting all files, so switched it out for file upload) 
* Cleaned and manipulated data with pandas to get desired information
* Showed basic statistical measures, implemented an interactive world map to present data related to location, selectable X & Y axis scatter plot, and interactive pie chart
